We collect certain information from users who interact with the Bot, including but not limited to:

    Feedback Analysis: To analyze user feedback and enhance the user experience.

4. Opt-In Requirement

Your data will only be collected if you opt in to the data collection process. Opting in is required for the Bot to personalize its responses and improve its functionality. You can opt in by acquiring the special Discord role "[AI Trainer]" in your server.

    Data Storage: Collected data is stored securely on our servers. Each user's data is stored separately, and server-level data is aggregated for analysis.
    Security Measures: We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction.

7. User Rights

    Opt-Out: You can opt out of data collection at any time by removing the "[AI Trainer]" role. Once removed, the Bot will no longer collect your data, but previously collected data may still be retained for analysis unless requested otherwise.
    Data Deletion: You have the right to request the deletion of your collected data. To do so, please contact a server moderator or use the gpt:clear command to delete your conversation history.
